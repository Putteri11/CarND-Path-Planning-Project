# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates]. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Reflections

Path planning in this project mostly consists of two parts: trajectory generation and behavioral planning. Prediction also plays a role, but not as much as the other two since the vehicles move pretty much at a constant speed. All of my code is in the file `main.cpp`.

I implemented behavioral planner as a finite state machine (lines 170-502), with states `"keep lane"`, `"prepare lane change left"`, `"prepare lane change right"`, `"lane change left"`, and `"lane change right"`. In the code I used shortcuts for these names e.g. `"keep lane" = "kl"`. The behavioral planner's main goal is to generate waypoints and set a target velocity for the car to follow. This is done by the method `get_wp` (lines 270-359), where the waypoints in states `"kl"`, `"plcl"`, and `"plcr"` are generated 30 meters apart in the positive s direction with a constant d value, i.e. they are generated in the heading direction in the lane of the car. In the states `"lcl"` and `"lcr"` the waypoints are generated such that the d value is gradually changed to the value `2 + 4 * intended_lane`, and both this gradual change and the distance between the waypoints in the s direction depend on the car's current speed. The target velocity is set to be the minimum of maximum allowed velocity and the minimum of the velocities of the closest car in front of the ego car both in the current and intended lane (if any and if there is a intended lane). The state is updated in the method `update_state` (lines 361-498) with a cost that takes into account the velocities of nearby cars (efficiency) and their distance in the s direction to the ego car (safety), and also tries to avoid unnecessary state changes.

I implemented trajectory generation very similarily to the way it was done in the project walkthrough i.e. I used the spline library and reused points from the previous cycle, but the reference velocity was updated differently. In my implementation, the velocity is updated every time before a new point is added to the list of next values which the car visits. This makes the car accelerate and decelerate much faster. Also the constraints, i.e. max acceleration and jerk, are taken into consideration while the reference velocity is trying to match the target velocity.

With this implementation, the car drives reasonnably well in the highway. However, there still are some things that could be improved. For example the car does not consider which lane would be optimal to be in in terms of efficiency in the long run. It does try to change lanes when it drives behind a slow-moving car but it cannot, for instance, plan to move it self to an empty left-most lane when driving in the right-most lane, when the two right-most lanes have a slow-moving car in them. Also, There could be improvements in the trajectory generation. Instead of a single set of waypoints being given to the controller, the behavioral planner could give at least a few sets of waypoints to the trajecory generator, and then a cost function could be applied to them to find the best one.
